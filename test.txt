my english book is a big fat book. But physics is only tiny as two papers. aah.

learning A FOR APPLE to Z FOR ZEBRA from my english book is my favourite activity.

it not only increases my  knowledge but also gives me a lot of pleasure.

having learnt all these will help me to pass in exams with good marks.

teachers would love me and i will always love my english book. Also my physics book.

Love is an awesome phenomemenon to be added to human life.
